## Assumptions

This tutorial assumes that you have a c-mass account. If not, sign up for a free account.

### Steps

1- **Get your API Key**

The first step is to generate an API key, which will allow you access to the CNaught APIs. Follow these steps:

- Log in to c-mass.
- Navigate to the APIs page under the Developers tab.
- Click the Create sandbox API key button to create a sandbox key, or click Set up API to create a production key (which will require you to set up a payment method).

<Warning>Save your API key somewhere safe; you will only be able to see it once. You can rotate your API key to a new one; the old one will remain valid for 24 hours.</Warning>

2- **Place an order**

Submit a credits order. Replace the `<C-MASS_API_KEY>` placeholder with the API key obtained in Step 1, and specify the amount of carbon credits (in kg of CO2e) you wish to purchase.

```javascript
curl --request POST \
  --url https://carbon-engine.onrender.com/api/v1/orders \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <C-MASS_API_KEY>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "portfolioId": "<string>",
  "amount_kg": 123,
  "description": "<string>"
}'
```
Youâ€™ll receive a response like this:

```javascript
{
  "message":"Order placed successfully",
  "order":{"_id":"ORD-1728559515925",
  "amount":0.88,
  "amountFulfilled":0.044,
  "price":0.02,
  "creditsPurchased":0.044,
  "createdOn":"2024-10-10T11:25:15.926Z"}
}
```

The `_id` (in this case `ORD-1728559515925`) will allow you to retrieve your order.
