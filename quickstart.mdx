## Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial, you need a c-mass account. If you don’t have one yet, you can sign up for a free account.

### Steps to Get Started

### 1. **Generate Your API Key**

Before making any requests, you’ll need an API key to authenticate with the c-mass API. Follow these steps:

- Log in to your c-mass account.
- Go to the **Devs** tab.
- Click **Create test API key** to generate a test key, or **Set up API** to create a live key (a payment method is required for live mode).

<Note> Learn more about <a href='/api-reference/introduction#test-mode'>**Test Mode**</a>.</Note>

<Warning> Store your API key securely, as it will only be displayed once. If needed, you can rotate your API key. The previous key will remain valid for 24 hours.</Warning>

### 2. **Placing an Order**

Once you have your API key, you can submit an order for carbon credits. Replace `<C-MASS_API_KEY>` with the API key you obtained in Step 1, and specify the amount of carbon credits (in kilograms of CO₂e) you want to purchase.

```javascript
curl --request POST \
  --url https://carbon-engine.onrender.com/v1/orders \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <C-MASS_API_KEY>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "amount_kg": 123,
  "description": "<string>",
  "customer": "<string>",
  "portfolioId": "<string>",
}'
You’ll receive a response like this:

javascript
{
  {
    "_id": "1728559515925",
    "orderNumber": "<string>",
    "description": "<string>",
    "price_sar_halalas": 123,
    "amount_kg": 123,
    "kg_price": 123,
    "callbackUrl": "<string>",
    "publicImpactPage": "<string>",
    "certificateUrl": "<string>",
    "state": "<string>",
    "portfolio": "<string>",
    "projectRecords": [
      {
        "project_id": "<string>",
        "project_category_id": "<string>",
        "credit_batch_id": "<string>",
        "delta": 123,
        "recorded_on": "2023-11-07T05:31:56Z"
      }
    ],
    "invoice": {
      "amountDueSarHalalas": 123,
      "balanceAppliedSarHalalas": 123,
      "receiptUrl": "<string>"
    }
  }

}


The _id (in this case 1728559515925) will allow you to retrieve your order.
