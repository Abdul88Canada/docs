title: 'Create Carbon Credits Order'
openapi: 'POST /v1/orders'
description: 'Places an order for the specified amount of carbon credits (in kilograms), or for the specified total price (in SAR halalas). The order will remain in the `placed` state until it can be matched to available credits, after which the order will be `fulfilled` and moved to the fulfilled state. If specifying total price, we will determine the amount of carbon credits based on the unit price of the portfolio used for the order. Because the amount must be an integer number of kilograms, the final actual total price might be slightly different than the specified total price.'
