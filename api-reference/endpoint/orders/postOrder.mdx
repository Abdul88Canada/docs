title: 'Create Carbon Credits Order'
openapi: 'POST /v1/orders'
description: 'Submits an order for a specified amount of carbon credits (in kilograms) or a designated total price (in SAR halalas). The order remains in the `placed` state until it is matched with available credits, at which point it transitions to the `fulfilled` state. If a total price is specified, the system calculates the corresponding amount of carbon credits based on the unit price of the selected portfolio. Since carbon credits must be purchased in whole kilograms, the final total price may vary slightly from the initially specified amount.'
