title: 'Cancel Order'
openapi: 'POST /v1/orders/{id}/cancel'
description: 'If a fulfilled order is canceled, a credit for the order's price will be applied to the current invoice. However, depending on the timing, the credit may appear on the invoice for the next billing period. For instance, if the billing cycle ends between the order placement and its cancellation, the credit will be applied to the following billing period instead of the one in which the order was originally placed.'
