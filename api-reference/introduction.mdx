## Welcome to c-mass API

Our API allows you to easily purchase carbon credits for various activities like transportation, logistics, and more.

## API endpoint

The base URL for this version of the API is `https://carbon-engine.onrender.com/v1`. All endpoints described in this documentation are relative to this base URL.


## Authentication

Clients must authenticate by including their c-mass API Key in the `Authorization` header. If the API key is invalid, a 401 error code will be returned.

Use your sandbox API key to make sandbox requests and production API key for production requests.

## Sandbox Mode
        
        c-mass includes a sandbox mode that allows you to try all the API functions without incurring any costs or actually purchasing credits. 
        
        - You can toggle sandbox mode via the switch in the web dashboard.
        - Use the same API endpoints for sandbox and production modes, but pass a sandbox API key.
        - Both sandbox and production API keys can be created from the Developers page.

## Authentication
        
        Clients authenticate by including their c-mass API Key in the ***Authorization*** header. If the API key is invalid, a **401 Unauthorized** error will be returned.
        
        - Use the sandbox API key for sandbox requests.
        - Use the production API key for production requests.

 ## Rate Limiting

        The c-mass API employs rate limiting to ensure stability.

        - **100 write and 100 read operations per second** are allowed.
        - Users who exceed these limits will receive a **429 Too Many Requests** response.
        - Implement a retry mechanism with **exponential backoff** for handling rate limits.

 ## Idempotency

        To prevent duplicate actions during failures and retries, the API supports idempotency. This ensures that retrying the same request (e.g., order placement) will perform the action only once.

        - Include an $$\Idempotency-Key:<key>\$$ header in your request to enable idempotency.
        - If the request has already been processed, the response will include an $$\X-Idempotent-Replay: true\$$ header.

 ## Error Codes

        The c-mass API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate success or failure:

        | Status Code | Error       | Description                              |
        | ----------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------- |
        | 400         | Bad Request     | Invalid request parameters.          |
        | 401         | Unauthorized    | Missing or invalid API key.          |
        | 403         | Forbidden       | Operation not allowed.               |
        | 409         | Conflict        | Idempotency conflict.                |
        | 422         | Unprocessable Entity     | Idempotency key used with different payload.          |
        | 429         | Too Many Requests        | Rate limit exceeded.               |
        | 503         | Service Unavailable        | Temporary server issue, retry the request.               |
