## Welcome to the c-mass API  

The c-mass API enables businesses to easily integrate carbon credit purchases into their operations, covering various activities such as transportation, logistics, and more.

## API Endpoint  

The base URL for this API version is: `https://carbon-engine.onrender.com/v1`

  
All endpoints referenced in this documentation are relative to this base URL.

---

## Authentication  

To access the API, clients must authenticate using their c-mass API Key by including it in the `Authorization` header.  

- If an invalid API key is provided, the API will return a **401 Unauthorized** error.  
- Use the **test API key** for test requests and the **live API key** for production requests.  

### Test Mode  

c-mass offers a **Test Mode** that allows users to explore API functionalities without incurring charges or purchasing real carbon credits.  

- Toggle Test Mode via the web dashboard.  
- The same API endpoints are used for both test and live modes, but a test API key must be provided.  
- API keys (both test and live) can be generated from the **Developers page**.

## Rate Limiting  

To maintain system stability, c-mass API enforces rate limits:  

- **100 write operations per second**  
- **100 read operations per second**  
- Requests exceeding these limits will return a **429 Too Many Requests** response.  

**Recommendation:** Implement a **retry mechanism with exponential backoff** to handle rate limits efficiently.

## Error Handling  

The c-mass API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of a request.  

| Status Code | Error                  | Description |
|-------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **400**     | Bad Request             | The request parameters are invalid. |
| **401**     | Unauthorized            | API key is missing or invalid. |
| **403**     | Forbidden               | Action is not permitted. |
| **409**     | Conflict                | Idempotency conflict detected. |
| **422**     | Unprocessable Entity    | Idempotency key used with a different payload. |
| **429**     | Too Many Requests       | API rate limit exceeded. |
| **503**     | Service Unavailable     | Temporary server issue, retry the request later. |
